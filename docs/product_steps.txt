1. Define and Collect Data
a) Labeling Focus States
You need labeled EEG data indicating when a person is in a “locked-in” hyperfocused state vs. other states. This can be done via:
	Controlled cognitive tasks designed to induce high focus (e.g., math problems, coding tasks, meditation).
  Self-reports or behavioral markers confirming focus.
  Physiological markers (e.g., eye tracking, pupil dilation, task performance metrics).

b) Data Collection
Use EEG devices (Muse, OpenBCI, etc.) with enough channels. Collect raw EEG signals, preferably with high temporal resolution. Synchronize EEG with task timestamps and
focus labels.

2. Preprocessing
Bandpass filtering to isolate classical EEG bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma). Compute time-frequency representations such as:
	Spectrograms (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
	Wavelet transforms for better time-frequency localization
Extract features:
	Power spectral density (PSD) or magnitude per frequency band
	Ratios between bands (e.g., Beta/Alpha ratio)
	Phase locking or coherence if you want connectivity features

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize averaged PSDs or spectrograms during locked-in vs. non-focused states. Use statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) to find frequencies/magnitudes that differ significantly.

Check for consistent patterns across participants.

4. Modeling Approach
a) Feature-Based Models
Classical ML: Use extracted features (frequency bands power, ratios, etc.) as input to:
	Logistic regression
	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	Random Forests / Gradient Boosting
	Neural Networks (simple dense layers)
This approach requires good handcrafted features and works well for interpretable models.

b) Deep Learning on Raw or Spectrogram Data
Use raw EEG time-series or spectrogram images as input to:
	CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for spatial/frequency patterns
	RNNs or LSTM/GRU for temporal dependencies
	Hybrid CNN-RNN architectures
	Deep learning can automatically learn complex feature representations but requires more data.

c) Unsupervised / Representation Learning
If labels are noisy or unavailable, try clustering or dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) on frequency-magnitude features to discover natural “locked-in” clusters.
	Autoencoders or contrastive learning to learn latent representations correlated with focus.

5. Validation
Cross-validate models on different subjects or sessions. Test generalizability to new tasks or environments. Compare against baselines (random, simpler models).

6. Interpretation and Insights
Use model explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to identify which frequency bands or magnitude features are most predictive. Relate findings back to neuroscience
literature about attention and EEG rhythms (e.g., Beta and Gamma increases often relate to focused attention).
