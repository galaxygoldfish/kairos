EXPERIMENT: Detecting "Locked-In" Flow States via EEG

OBJECTIVE:
To determine when a user enters a mental "flow state" (locked-in focus) using EEG signals, task performance, and self-reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1. TASK DESIGN
------------------------------------------------------------------

Create tasks that vary in difficulty and cognitive load:

A) Boring Task (Low Load)
   - Repetitive clicking
   - Easy math problems

B) Challenging Task (Flow Zone)
   - Puzzles or logic problems that gradually increase in difficulty
   - Coding mini-challenges
   - Rhythm-based games

C) Overwhelming Task (High Load)
   - Tasks with time pressure beyond user capability
   - Impossible puzzles

Each task is done in ~3–5 minute blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SELF-REPORTED FLOW
------------------------------------------------------------------

After each task block, ask the user:

- "How 'in the zone' were you during this task? (1 to 10)"
- "How difficult was the task? (1 to 10)"
- Optional: Use a modified Flow State Scale (FSS)

------------------------------------------------------------------
3. EEG SETUP
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use EEG headset (e.g., 8–32 channels)
- Sampling rate: ≥256 Hz
- Key electrodes: Fz, Cz, Pz, FCz, etc.

Preprocessing:
- Bandpass filter EEG: 0.5–40 Hz
- Artifact removal: blink/motion correction if possible

Extract features:
- Band power in theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz)
- Focus on:
  - Frontal-midline theta (e.g., Fz)
  - Parietal alpha (e.g., Pz)
  - Frontal beta (e.g., FCz)

Optional:
- Compute coherence or phase-locking values between electrodes
- Look for increased connectivity in frontal-parietal networks

------------------------------------------------------------------
4. LABEL AND TRAIN
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Label each task block with the self-reported flow score
- Extract features from EEG during the same period
- Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, or shallow neural net)
- Inputs: Band power, coherence
- Output: Flow probability score (0 to 1)

------------------------------------------------------------------
5. VALIDATION AND BEHAVIORAL METRICS
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Track task performance: accuracy, speed, reaction time
- Optional:
  - Heart rate variability (HRV)
  - Mouse/keyboard rhythm
  - Eye-tracking (fewer saccades during flow)

Check correlation between:
- Predicted flow vs. self-reported flow
- Predicted flow vs. performance metrics

------------------------------------------------------------------
6. OPTIONAL: REAL-TIME FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Display a flow meter or heatmap to user
- Adapt task difficulty in real time based on focus
- Trigger breaks or nudges if user drops out of flow

------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF KEY EEG MARKERS:
------------------------------------------------------------------

- ↑ Frontal beta (13–25 Hz): active attention
- ↑ Parietal alpha (8–12 Hz): relaxed alertness
- ↑ Midline theta (4–8 Hz): cognitive control
- ↓ Prefrontal overactivation: transient hypofrontality (in some cases)
- ↑ Fronto-parietal coherence: focused engagement
